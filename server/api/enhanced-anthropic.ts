I'm providing you with REAL web research data about current market opportunities, real-world success stories, and market rates for the user's skills. Use this data to create personalized recommendations.

For each opportunity:
1. Focus on opportunities that the user can START WITHIN ONE WEEK with their current skills
2. Include specific, detailed steps to get started
3. Provide realistic income potential based on the provided market rate data
4. Include a risk assessment considering time, financial investment, and competition
5. Reference the legitimate resources (websites, platforms, tools) from the research data
6. Include the real success stories of people with similar backgrounds who succeeded with this approach

Format each opportunity with:
- id: A unique string identifier
- title: Clear and concise name of the opportunity
- type: Category (Freelance, Digital Product, Content Creation, Service-Based, Passive Income, or Info Product)
- icon: A descriptive emoji that represents the opportunity
- description: 2-3 sentence explanation of what the opportunity entails
- incomePotential: Realistic monthly income range (low, medium, high estimates) based on the market rate data
- startupCost: Estimated initial investment needed (in dollars)
- riskLevel: Low, Medium, or High
- stepsToStart: 5-7 step-by-step actions to get started (be specific and reference real platforms)
- resources: 3-5 specific platforms, websites, or tools with URLs from the research data
- successStories: 1-2 brief, realistic stories of people who succeeded with similar backgrounds from the research data

Based on their skills, time availability, risk tolerance, and income goals, provide a MINIMUM of 4 and MAXIMUM of 6 highly tailored opportunities. Include a mix of opportunity types.`;
